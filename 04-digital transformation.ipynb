    "Li & Fung sought to reduce production lead times, increase speed-to-market, and improve the use of data in its global supply chain. After concrete goals were established, the company decided on which digital tools it would adopt. Just to take speed-to-market as an example, Li & Fung has embraced virtual design technology and it has helped them to reduce time from design to sample by 50%. Li & Fung also helped suppliers to install real-time data tracking management systems to increase production efficiency and built Total Sourcing, a digital platform that integrates information from customers and vendors. The finance department took a similar approach and ultimately reduced month-end closing time by more than 30% and increased working capital efficiency by $200 million."
