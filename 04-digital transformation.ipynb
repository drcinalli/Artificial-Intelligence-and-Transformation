    "Li & Fung sought to reduce production lead times, increase speed-to-market, and improve the use of data in its global supply chain. After concrete goals were established, the company decided on which digital tools it would adopt. Just to take speed-to-market as an example, Li & Fung has embraced virtual design technology and it has helped them to reduce time from design to sample by 50%. Li & Fung also helped suppliers to install real-time data tracking management systems to increase production efficiency and built Total Sourcing, a digital platform that integrates information from customers and vendors. The finance department took a similar approach and ultimately reduced month-end closing time by more than 30% and increased working capital efficiency by $200 million.\n",

Those findings are consistent with our experience, which is that cross-functional operations transformations—emphasizing the interactions between product development, procurement, manufacturing, supply chains, capital expenditures, and services (exhibit)—typically outperform their single-function counterparts by between 30 and 40 percent.

To help bring these outside voices into the organization, many CDOs establish advisory boards of start-up leaders or create “challenger” boards of people with digital experience and expertise to review corporate initiatives and strategies. At a more pedestrian level, they regularly invite technologists or entrepreneurs to team lunches.\n",
